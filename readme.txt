This is a library called cpt_tools. This software contains a GUI for online control and analysis of the CPT phase-imaging system, software for offline analysis, and other useful tools. See the documentation section for the following information:

* User guide: guide to using the system without understanding how the software works. Anyone who is going to control the CPT, e.g. for a shift, should read this.

* Programmer guide: guide to the software architecture. If you are going to modify the program to introduce new features, you should read this.

* Mass identifier: this is a tool that can look up potential nuclide and molecule matches to CPT measured cyclotron frequencies.
